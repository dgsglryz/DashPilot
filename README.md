## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop 24+ (with Docker Compose v2)
- Node.js 20.19+
- Git 2.40+

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dgsglryz/DashPilot.git
cd DashPilot

# 2. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Launch Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Install dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install

# 5. Generate application key
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# 6. Run migrations + seed demo data
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed

The seeder will create:
- 1 demo admin user (demo@dashpilot.test / Password123)
- 12 developer users
- 35 clients
- 130 demo sites with health data
- Sample alerts, tasks, reports, and activity logs
- 20 Liquid snippets for Shopify editor
- 5 webhook configurations

# 7. Build frontend assets
docker-compose exec app npm run build

# 8. Start queue workers (in a separate terminal or background)
docker-compose exec app php artisan queue:work --queue=health-checks,emails,webhooks --tries=3

# Or run in background:
docker-compose exec -d app php artisan queue:work --queue=health-checks,emails,webhooks --tries=3
```

### Access Services

- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8080
- **MailHog**: http://localhost:8025

**Default Credentials** (Development/Demo only - automatically created by database seeder):

```
Email: demo@dashpilot.test
Password: Password123
```

> **Note:** These credentials are for local development only. Never use default credentials in production. The demo account and all dummy data (130 sites, 35 clients, sample alerts, tasks, etc.) are automatically created when you run `php artisan migrate --seed` in step 6.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Modular Monolith Structure

```
app/
├── Modules/
│   ├── Sites/            # WordPress & Shopify integrations
│   ├── Alerts/           # Rule engine, acknowledgements
│   ├── Notifications/    # Email + webhook delivery
│   ├── Clients/          # CRM + reporting
│   ├── Tasks/            # Kanban + assignments
│   ├── SEO/              # Scoring service

│   └── Shopify/          # Liquid editor + services
├── Shared/               # Traits, helpers, services
└── Http/                 # Middleware, controllers
```

### Key Components

**Health Check System:**

- Scheduler dispatches `CheckSiteHealth` job every 5 minutes
- Jobs processed via Redis queue
- Results cached in Redis (5-min TTL)
- Alerts created when thresholds breached

**Notification System:**

- Email notifications via queued `SendEmailNotification` job
- Webhooks delivered through `DeliverWebhook` job with retry logic
- HMAC signatures for webhook security

**Caching Strategy:**

- Dashboard stats: 60s TTL
- WordPress health: 5min TTL
- Shopify analytics: 10min TTL
- SEO scores: 1hr TTL

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
docker-compose exec app php artisan test

# Frontend lint
docker-compose exec app npm run lint

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e
```

**Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite including unit tests for services, feature tests for controllers, and E2E tests covering Sites, Alerts, Notifications, SEO, and Shopify modules.

### Site-Specific API Credentials

Stored in `sites` table (not `.env`):

**WordPress Sites:**

**Shopify Sites:**

- `shopify_store_url`: Store domain
- `shopify_access_token`: Admin API access token

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Queue not processing

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan queue:work --queue=health-checks,emails,webhooks --verbose
```

### Redis connectivity errors

```bash
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
docker-compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
```

### Database connection refused

```bash
docker-compose logs db
docker-compose restart db
sleep 10
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
```

### WordPress/Shopify API failures

- Verify API credentials in `sites` table
- Check Telescope logs at `/telescope`
- Update secrets if expired

### Tests failing

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --env=testing
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```
